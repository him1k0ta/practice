Practice:
ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a simple and widely known letter substitution cipher used in online forums and text files to obscure text, such as spoiler warnings or offensive content. 
This method replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. A becomes N, B becomes O, C becomes P, and so forth.
Because the Latin alphabet has 26 letters, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding.
